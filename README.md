## Travel Planner Using Graph Algorithms

This project is a travel planning application that calculates the optimal path and travel route from a source to a destination using various modes of transportation. The core functionality leverages the renowned Dijkstra's Algorithm, a well-known graph-based approach for finding the shortest paths in weighted graphs.

### Key Features

- **Optimal Route Calculation**: Computes the most efficient route between two locations based on specified criteria.
- **Graph Representation**: Supports different types of graphs, including directed, undirected, and weighted graphs.
- **Algorithmic Variety**: In addition to Dijkstra’s Algorithm, the project includes implementations of Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
- **User Interface**: Offers an interactive interface for users to input data and visualize travel routes.
